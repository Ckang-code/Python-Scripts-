# Python Scripts for Cybersecurity Engineering

This repository is a collection of Python scripts and lightweight utilities I’ve written to support day-to-day cybersecurity engineering, analysis, and automation tasks.  
The scripts here are designed to be practical, self-contained, and easy to adapt — ranging from network enrichment tools (whois, passive DNS lookups, pcap parsing) to quick automations for security operations and engineering workflows.  

## Goals
- Provide **small, focused utilities** that solve specific problems quickly.  
- Serve as a **toolbox for cybersecurity engineers** working in areas like threat hunting, network traffic analysis, automation, and forensics.  
- Act as a personal knowledge base for reusable code snippets and patterns.  

## Organization
Scripts are organized by categories, such as the folowing:
- `networking/` — traffic parsing, IP enrichment, protocol analysis
- `forensics/` — artifact extraction, log parsing
- `automation/` — everyday scripting and workflow helpers

## Usage
Each folder may include:
- The script(s)
- A `README.md` with usage notes
- A `requirements.txt` if dependencies are needed

All scripts are written for **Python 3** and kept minimal with standard libraries whenever possible.
